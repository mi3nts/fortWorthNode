# Central Node Design Overview
## Introduction 
Portable devices which can detect airbourne particulates are finding its way into current consumer markets. Unlike there bulky, stationary counterparts the small scale nature of such sensors feeds into a more user friendly, hazzle free platform. The current document proposes such a portable device which encorpates a relatively inexpensive particulate sensor with an ensemble of other popular IOT Sensors.

### Design Specifications  

#### Absolute Necessities 
1. Main Housing:
 - The enclosed device should fit a bike bottle housing.

2. OPC Sensor: 
 - Must have the Alhpa Sense OPC-N3 <br/>

3. Automated Notifications 
 - Should sound an alarm when passing through dirty air. 

4. Secondary Sensors: 
- Must have Temprature, Humidity, Pressure and GPS sensors.   

5. Battery:
- Must contain a rechargable portable battery which will enable the device to stay on for atleast for 4 hours.
- Must have an indicator which shows the status of the battery Charge.
- Should be able to work 24*7 when connected to power(Charging pod).


6. Date Storage: 
- The device should be capable of storing at least 24 hours of Data.  
- The Storage output should be a csv 
- Should be accessible to the end user 

7. Weight 
- Must weigh less than 1 Kg.

8. Cost 
- The Whole sensor should cost less than 2000$.


##### Attractive Addons 

1. Secondary Sensors: 
- Inclusion of gas sensors such as NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), O3 (Ozone), CO (Carbon Monoxide), SO2 (Sulfer Dioxide), and H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide). 

2. Battery:
- A portable battery which will enable the device to stay on for atleast **24 hours** per charge.

3. Date Storage: 
- Automated Cloud link

4. Mobile App
- Inclusion of an andorid/ios app which will give out live statistics from the data collected.

5. Weight 
- Weigh less than 500g.

6. Cost 
- Getting the cost to be less than 1000$.

7. Wireless Connectivity 
- Inlcussion of a wireless modem and have the possibiilty of WiFi.
